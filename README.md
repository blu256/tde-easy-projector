# TDE Easy Projector

This program helps set up a projector or external screen. It was born out of the need for an extremely simple utility for setting up a projector for a presentation.

Behind the scenes, it is a wrapper around the Trinity KRandrSimpleApi class and the `xrandr` utility.

There are two modes available: screen duplication and screen extension. Its main GUI consists from just three big buttons ;-)
